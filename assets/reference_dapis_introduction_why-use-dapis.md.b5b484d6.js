Furthermore, Beacons that underlie dAPIs allow the user to inspect what exact API endpoints are being called, and with which parameters. This provides complete transparency to the dApp developer, which is a big step from depending on a pseudonymous selection of third parties that intentionally obscure their data sources.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">dAPI Browser</p><p>dAPIs source data from Beacons, whose parameters you can examine in detail.

Furthermore, first-party data feeds do not require redundancy against middlemen layer attacks. This makes single-Beacon dAPIs feasible, and allows API3 to provide a wide variety of data feeds in a cost-efficient way.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: An inherently secure and cost-efficient data feed design allows API3 to build a large number of them, on many chains. This is supplemented by purpose-designed Airnode protocols and relayer schemes to improve efficiency while not degrading the security guarantees of a first-party data feed. The improved scalability of dAPIs also factors into building aggregated data feeds. Since first-party data feeds do not require redundancy at the middlemen layer, the aggregation costs less gas and source-level decentralization becomes more affordable.</p>',6);function A(a,v,w,I,P,T){const n=i("TitleSpan"),d=i("router-link");return l(),p("div",null,[r(n,null,{default:s(()=>[t(o(a.$frontmatter.sidebarHeader),1)]),_:1}),e("h1",u,[t(o(a.$frontmatter.title)+" ",1),m]),y,_,r(d,{to:"/reference/airnode/latest/"},{default:s(()=>[g]),_:1}),b])}const B=c(f,[["render",A]]);export{k as __pageData,B as default};

Any one Beacon, identified by an ID, has a single value. A dAPI may in fact get values from several Beacons and average the values, and/or apply other logic, before returning a single value to the reader.</p><p>dAPIs can be fluid because they use a publicly known set of Beacons to source values from. The list of Beacons could be altered for best-in-time results (e.g. Beacon availability) without a reader needing to change the code of its smart contract. Beacons could come and go but dAPIs are durable. Because of this flexibility it is always best to use the dAPI name rather than Beacon IDs which are fixed.</p><ul><li>dAPI name: A human readable name that represents a Beacon or Beacon set.
